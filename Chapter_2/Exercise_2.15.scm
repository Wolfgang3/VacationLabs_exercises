// Eva Lu Ator result
=>
; I think eva is correct bcuz as we can see from the earlier procedure par1 has mul-interval, so if there is any error ir may increase cuz of mul-interval. as we can see in par2 it involves div-interval which may cancle out error if it exists.

; so i think par2 is better to compute intervals.
