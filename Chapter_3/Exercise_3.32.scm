;; y use queue in agenda?
;=> 

; since all the operations of a procedure are interdependent on each other. it is very import to use queue
; if we want the correct order of the operation.
; if use other implementation like stack LIFO we might get wrong output.
; eg. In half-adder all the next result are dependent on the previous value of the input.
; that is why a queue has to be used in agenda.
