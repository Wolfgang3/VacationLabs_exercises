=> sine of angle
a) given the value as 12.15

(sine 12.15) 
(p (sine 4.05))    #else part and divide the angle by 3.0
(p (p (sine 1.35))) 
(p (p (p (sine 0.45)))) 
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15))))) 
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05)))))) 
(p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))
...from the bove ste we can see that the sine is no longer in the pitcher therefore sine executes 5 times.

b) the order of growth in space and the number of steps is logarithmic. i.e. in the order of O(log(x))
